abstract: "Aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) plays fundamental roles in atmospheric radiation and chemical processes. However, there is little information about ALWC vertical distribution due to the lack of sufficient measurement. In this study, a novel method to retrieve ALWC using a polarization lidar is proposed. By analyzing lidar measurement combined with in situ chemical composition measurements at the surface, the particle linear depolarization ratio δp is found to be well correlated with the liquid water mass fraction. The method is built upon a valid relationship between δp and the ratio of ALWC to the particle backscatter coefficient. ALWC can be retrieved with a relative error of 30% with this method. A case study shows that the ALWC in upper levels of the boundary layer may be different from that at the ground, suggesting the importance of measuring ALWC vertical profiles during haze episodes. The study proves that polarization lidars have the potential to retrieve vertical distributions of ALWC which will benefit studies on haze formation."
