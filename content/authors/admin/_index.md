Wangshu Tan currently works at School of Optics and Photonics, Beijing Institute of Technology as a post-doctoral researcher. His research interest is lidar remote sensing of atmospheric parameters (e.g. temperature, wind, aerosols, clouds, and water vapor) and their impacts on environment, weather, and climate.
Wangshu is looking for collaborators on lidar remote sensing of atmospheric parameters and corresponding applications.
